# Computer-Vision-Projects

Computer Vision projects involve applying artificial intelligence to visual data, tackling tasks like image classification, object detection, facial recognition, gesture recognition, and image segmentation. These projects leverage deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), to interpret and understand visual information. Whether it's recognizing objects in images, detecting anomalies, or generating new visual content, Computer Vision projects span diverse domains such as healthcare, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. Success in these projects relies on labeled datasets, preprocessing techniques, and tailored evaluation metrics to ensure accurate and meaningful results.
